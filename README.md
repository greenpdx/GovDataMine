To data-mine goverenment and use machine learning to find inequality (system is rigged)

Data-mine local government.

My assignment in Writing 115 was to compare Ferguson with Baltimore.  I compared judicial revenue to the population’s wealth.  

I wanted to find out the economics of the judicial system in relation to income inequality. The goal was to normalise the revenue and cost of the courts to the wealth of the population’s it serves.  An example is a $100 fine to a poor person could 15% of their monthly income while $10,000 is just daily expense for a rich person. This also translates to the ability to afford legal representation which effects the outcome.  In short wealth inequality creates judicial inequality.   “America has the best justice system money can buy”.

Judicial revenue /  Capita.  Using dollars normalised to income of the population(1).  

Ferguson | $148 | Fines and penalties.

Baltimore | $52 | Parking and red light cameras. 

Hillsboro | $8n | too small. 

It is clean from the data that the “justice” in America is not equal. Ferguson demographics has low population density and low income while Baltimore has high population density and low income. That changes the main revenue stream.  In low density population, the personal touch of fines and exponential penalties are the main source of revenue. In Baltimore, automated parking meters and red light cameras is the judicial revenue stream. Because Hillsboro is so wealthy, court revenue is very small compared to the rest of America, but the civil court actions are much greater.         
 
Excessive force by the police is the first level of judicial abuse created by wealth inequality. It is more cost efficient the handle legal problems lower on the judicial chain. The police use fear and intimidation to control people cost less than going to court, just like plea bargain cost less than a trial. 

I received a D on the paper, but that paper started my interest public records data mining, not for personal data but for patterns.  Companies and government use data to maximize profits and control the people. It’s now time for the people to data-mine the government to find the inequalities and injustice.  

My goal is to mathematically describe that money does legally create a opportunity bias and because of changes and feedback in the system, it will only get worse.   Starting in the 1970’s, communication and computerized logistics allowed companies to move manufacturing out of America for greater profit.  Staring in the 1990’s, companies started to import workers to reduce costs using H-1B visas. Now companies are replacing American workers by using machine learning and automation(3).
